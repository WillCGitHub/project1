#
# XXX: The URI should be in the format of:
#
#     postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@<IP_OF_POSTGRE_SQL_SERVER>/postgres
#
# For example, if you had username ewu2493, password foobar, then the following line would be:
#
#     DATABASEURI = "postgresql://ewu2493:foobar@<IP_OF_POSTGRE_SQL_SERVER>/postgres"

# Swap out the URI below with the URI for the database created in part 2
DATABASEURI = "postgresql://bsl2127:28fah@104.196.175.120/postgres"

#
#     .tables               -- will list the tables in the database
